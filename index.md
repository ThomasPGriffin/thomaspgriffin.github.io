<p>I am a Finance PhD Candidate in the LeBow College of Business at Drexel University. My research lies at the intersection of corporate finance and international trade.</p>

<p>I am interested in how globalization affects corporate investment and financing decisions. My job market paper shows that a tariff policy change that increased trade with China led to a decline in U.S. public listing rates and elevated industry concentration. My findings suggest that globalization contributed to recent trends in the U.S. equity market by disproportionately harming small firms. </p>

<p>I am also broadly interested in corporate governance. My research in this area studies the evolution of creditor control rights over the past two decades and examines how creditors use these rights to influence corporate outcomes.</p>

<p>My work has been presented at selective conferences, such as <i>WFA</i>, <i>FIRS</i>, and the <i>Texas A&M Young Scholars Finance Consortium</i>. It also has been featured on <i>Columbia Law Schoolâ€™s Blue Sky Blog</i> and the <i>Harvard Law School Program on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation</i>.</p>

<p>I am excited to join Villanova University as an Assistant Professor of Finance in Fall 2019!</p>
