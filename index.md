<p>I am currently the Vincent B. DiDomenico, Jr. '88 Assistant Professor of Finance & Real Estate at Villanova University. In Fall 2022, I will be on sabbatical from Villanova and will work as a Visiting Scholar at the University of Virginia, McIntire School of Commerce. I research issues in empirical corporate finance, with a particular interest in financial contracting and corporate governance. My papers in this area study the evolution of corporate loan covenants over the past two decades and examine how lenders use contractual rights to influence firm outcomes. </p>

<p>My work has been published in the <i>Review of Financial Studies</i> and presented at selective conferences, such as <i>AFA</i>, <i>WFA</i>, <i>EFA</i>, <i>SFS Cavalcade</i>, <i>FIRS</i>, the <i>Washington University in St. Louis Corporate Finance Conference</i>, the <i>Texas A&M Young Scholars Finance Consortium</i>, and the <i>Drexel University Corporate Governance Conference</i>. It also has been featured on <i>Columbia Law Schoolâ€™s Blue Sky Blog</i> and the <i>Harvard Law School Program on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation</i>.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss corporate debt research and current events, or collaborate on a project, please contact me at thomas.griffin@villanova.edu.</p>
