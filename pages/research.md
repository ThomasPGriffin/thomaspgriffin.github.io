#### *[Creditor Control of Corporate Acquisitions]({{ BASE_PATH}}/pages/bgn_20200918.pdf)* – with <a href="https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/davidbecher">David Becher</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gregnini/home">Greg Nini</a>
##### Forthcoming at the *Review of Financial Studies*
<div align="justify"> 
We examine the impact of creditor control rights on corporate acquisitions. Nearly 75% of loan agreements include restrictions that limit borrower acquisition decisions throughout the life of the contract. Following a financial covenant violation, creditors use their bargaining power to tighten these restrictions and limit acquisition activity, particularly deals expected to earn negative announcement returns. Firms that do announce an acquisition after violating a financial covenant earn 1.8% higher stock returns, on average, and do not pursue less risky deals. We conclude that creditors use contractual rights and the renegotiation process to limit value-destroying acquisitions driven by managerial agency problems.

#### *[Losing Control? The 20-Year Decline in Loan Covenant Restrictions]({{ BASE_PATH}}/pages/violTrend_20191118.pdf)* – with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gregnini/home">Greg Nini</a> and <a href="https://www.commerce.virginia.edu/faculty/smith">David Smith</a>
<div align="justify"> 
This paper finds that lenders today rely on less restrictive financial covenants compared to 20 years ago, resulting in a nearly 70% drop in the annual proportion of U.S. public firms reporting a covenant violation. To study this decline, we develop a simple model of optimal covenant design that balances the costs associated with violations that occur when a firm is not in danger of financial distress (“false positives”) with the costs of failing to detect a borrower in danger of financial distress (“false negatives”). We present evidence that lenders have eased the restrictiveness of covenants in ways that greatly reduce the ratio of false positives relative to false negatives, including by switching to covenant packages with higher signal-to-noise ratios.

#### *[Shareholder Litigation Risk and the Information Environment: Revisiting Evidence from Two Natural Experiments]({{ BASE_PATH}}/pages/bfg_20210316.pdf)* – with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/audralboone/home?authuser=0">Audra Boone</a> and <a href="https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/eliezerfich">Eliezer Fich</a>

Reducing the threat of shareholder litigation through securities class actions lowers voluntary disclosure quantity, but not the accuracy of earnings forecasts. Conversely, reducing the threat of shareholder litigation through derivative lawsuits prompts increases in voluntary disclosure quantity and decreases in both earnings forecast accuracy and mandatory disclosure quality. We reconcile these differences by showing that changes to firm operations are the economic mechanism driving changes in corporate information environments after the threat of derivative lawsuits exogenously declines. This evidence comports with the fact that, while securities class action lawsuits address disclosure decisions, derivative litigation also covers decisions about real operations.

I show that a tariff policy change that increased trade with China led to a decline in U.S. public listing rates and elevated industry concentration. Consistent with heterogeneous firm models of trade, the shock impeded the entry and performance of small domestic manufacturers but did not adversely impact large multinationals. In addition, stock price reactions to the policy change and threat of reversal imply that trade liberalization creates or destroys value depending on firm size. These findings suggest that recent trends in the U.S. public equity market are driven, in part, by fundamental changes in the global competitive landscape.
