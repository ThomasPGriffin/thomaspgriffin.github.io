### <u>JOB MARKET PAPER<u>

#### *Globalization and U.S. Industry Concentration*
Since the turn of the 21st century, the U.S. has experienced abnormally low IPO activity, high delisting rates, and increased levels of industry concentration. This paper proposes globalization as a contributing factor behind these trends. Using a U.S. tariff policy change that increased trade with China, I find that exposed industries suffered a drop in the number of listed firms and a spike in concentration. Firm-level analyses show that the trade shock impeded the entry and performance of small manufacturers but did not adversely impact large multinational corporations, consistent with heterogeneous firm models of trade. These findings suggest that globalization contributed to recent trends in the public U.S. equity market by disproportionately harming small firms.

### <u>WORKING PAPERS<u>

#### *Creditor Control of Corporate Acquisitions* – with David Becher and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gregnini/home">Greg Nini</a>
We examine the impact of creditor control rights on corporate acquisitions. Nearly 75% of private credit
agreements restrict borrower acquisition decisions. Following a covenant violation, creditors use their
bargaining power to tighten these restrictions and limit acquisition activity, particularly deals expected to
earn negative announcement returns. Firms that do announce an acquisition while in violation of a
covenant earn 1.8% higher stock returns, on average, with the effect concentrated among firms with weak
external governance. We conclude that creditors provide valuable corporate governance that benefits
shareholders by reducing managerial agency costs.

#### *Losing Control: The 20-Year Decline in Loan Covenant Restrictions* – with Greg Nini and David Smith
Over the last twenty years, financial covenants in syndicated loan agreements have steadily become looser. The result is that the fraction of U.S. public companies reporting a violation of a loan covenant during a given year decreased from over 12% in 1997 to less than 5% in 2016. Although the decline accelerates in recent years, the trend is present prior to the recent financial crisis. The trend cannot be explained by changes in the composition of public firms, a decrease in the usage of debt, or a long series of positive ex-post outcomes for firms. Nor does the rise in institutional lenders or an increased supply of credit entirely explain the decline. The loosening of covenants is widespread among all types of borrowers and loans and accompanies an increase in loan spreads over the period, suggesting that the trend reflects fundamental changes in the costs and benefits of tight covenants.

#### *Shareholder Litigation and the Information Environment* – with Audra Boone and Eliezer Fich
Does the threat of shareholder litigation affect firms’ information environments? We find that a Delaware court ruling that strengthened shareholder litigation rights generated positive abnormal returns. We also examine staggered adoptions of universal demand (UD) laws, which weakened shareholders’ ability to sue corporate officers. After UD laws pass, financial statements become more opaque, analyst dispersion and forecast error increases, and the trading environment deteriorates. Moreover, firms incorporated in UD states are less likely to face regulatory enforcements although insider trading profits are higher. Our results suggest that stronger shareholder litigation rights increase firm value, improve transparency, and mitigate agency problems.
